# Stockbit Bibit Test

Here is repository to keep my solutions of the test problems. You can run these commands to run the solutions and see if the solutions match the expected solutions.

## Find First String in Bracket Refactor Problem

Run this command to see the results of this function after refactoring.

```bash
npm run find-words

For adding additional test case, you can directly do it in the sandbox files in the refactor-code directory. Here is the example of the command to use to add the additional test case.

```js
testString = '(tested string) tested string';
validateRefactorSolution(testString);
```

```bash
npm run anagram

```js
testArray = ['string', 'string', 'string', 'string'];
console.log(anagram(testArray));
```
